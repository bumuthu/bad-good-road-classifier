# Bad-Good road classifier

In this project, I compared the accuracy of CNN architectures training for a road classifier (binary classification).

Trained the model using pretrained models as transfer learning method.
Compared the accuracies with 5 different CNN backbones.

1. VGG19
2. ResNet50
3. Xception
4. InceptionV3
5. InceptionResNetV2

The results can be seen in `Good-Bad Road Reporting.pdf`.

Thanks a lot.
